In the realm of modern development, we find ourselves at the intersection of creativity and technology. The landscape continues to evolve, bringing new challenges and opportunities to those who dare to explore its depths.

### Key Concepts

1. **Innovation** drives our industry forward
   - Embracing new technologies
   - Finding creative solutions
   - Pushing boundaries

2. **Constant-Like Data
Modern JavaScript introduced another new keyword, const, for declaring constants such as data types. Like let, const does not create properties of the global object when declared globally. They, too, are considered non-hoisted, as they cannot be accessed before being declared.
Constants in JavaScript are different from those in many other languages, where they function as immutable data types. In JavaScript, constants only look immutable. In fact, they are read-only references to their value. Therefore, you cannot directly reassign another value to the variable identifier for primitive data types. However, objects or arrays are non-primitive data types, so even when you use const, you can mutate their values through methods or direct property access.
In Listing 2-9, we declare both a primitive and a non-primitive data type with the const keyword and try to change their content.

const primitiveDataType = 1;
try {
    primitiveDataType = 2;
} catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
}
