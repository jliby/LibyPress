Got it ‚Äî from now on, every time I generate a response, I‚Äôll log it in chat_log.md. You‚Äôll have a running archive of all responses directly in your project. Let‚Äôs get that log rolling. üìùüíæ

Sure, here‚Äôs a clear project summary and WinSurf-style instructions for the book viewer you‚Äôre building in Cursor:

üìö Project Summary: AI 3D Book Library

You‚Äôre creating an interactive, Stripe Press‚Äìinspired digital bookshelf using Next.js, React Three Fiber, and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to view books in a 3D environment with togglable vertical or horizontal stacks, realistic canvas-textured covers, and detailed spine/front titles using @react-three/drei/Text. Users can scroll through books, hover to animate, and click for interaction. A slick Apple-style HUD offers controls for zoom and orientation. Navigation is enhanced with a left-side dot list and centered header tools.

üß™ WinSurf-Style Instructions (steps to replicate & dev tasks)

# 1. Setup Project
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei framer-motion classnames

# 2. Project Structure
- app/library/page.tsx            // Main UI + Canvas layout + toggle logic
- components/Book3D.tsx          // Single book with texture, animation, and 3D logic
- components/VerticalNav.tsx     // Left dot-based nav synced with scroll
- public/textures/               // Holds textures like `book_pattern_col1_4k.png`
- chat_log.md                    // Conversation history log

# 3. Stack Books in 3D
- Use <Canvas> from R3F
- Wrap <Book3D /> in <ScrollControls> from @drei
- Handle layoutMode (vertical/horizontal)
- Scroll affects Y-position (or X if horiz)

# 4. Book3D.tsx
- Uses BoxGeometry for book shape
- Applies:
    - Texture map: `book_pattern_col1_4k.png`
    - Color tint: `coverColor`
    - Roughness: high (matte)
- Adds crisp <Text /> for:
    - Spine (rotated)
    - Cover (centered)
- Animates hover using useFrame + lerp

# 5. Navigation
- VerticalNav rendered OUTSIDE canvas
- Uses activeIndex + scrollToIndex logic
- Syncs with book stack scroll offset

# 6. UI Controls
- Top-center: layout toggle (|||)
- Top-right: "Add Book" + User icon
- Centered search (macOS-style expanding icon)
- Bottom-center: Expandable HUD (zoom/orientation/reset) ‚Äî Apple-like design
